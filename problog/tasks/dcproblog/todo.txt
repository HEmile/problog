* add mat(), vec(), predicates to instantiate matrices and vector should be within "is" predicate on right hand side
* with mat(), vec() multivariate distributions will be possible

* would be really nice: implement stochastic variational inference with pyro

* adapt subquery predicate, does not work correctly right now

* add logprobability for inference with pyro
