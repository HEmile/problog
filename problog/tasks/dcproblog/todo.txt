* add mat(), vec(), predicates to instantiate matrices and vector should be within "is" predicate on right hand side
* with mat(), vec() multivariate distributions will be possible
* add support for solving IndianGPA
* would be really nice: implement stochastic variational inference with pyro
* adapt subquery predicate, does not work correctly right now
* allow non-ground terms in density_query/1, solved now via between in body of query (observation/2 probably does not allow this at the moment either)
* query_density without evidence fails/not correct, because density not in random_values
